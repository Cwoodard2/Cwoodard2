### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Cameron Woodard and I am a front-end developer that also does some freelance work. I am a senior at SIUE (Southern Illinois University Edwardsville) studying computer science. I believe that technology should be used to enhance and improve our lives but not in a way that benefits companies more than us. I focus on design that improves user experience while practicing ideas that keep the tech just as a tool. If you want to see some of my work look around my github or check out my portfolio at https://Cwoodard2.github.io!
